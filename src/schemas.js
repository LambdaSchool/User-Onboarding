//here is where we define our schema for validating the form input we use the 3rd-party library yup for this purpose 
//we chain methods yup.Object().shape(...)
//shape is passed an object which defines our validation rules 
//this object's structure mirrors the object structure of formValues (where our inputs are in state)
//each key -> value here is a bunch of method chains on the yup library which assert certain rules for each input
//ie. is require, data type, max length, min length, expected value, expect pattern (e.g. email)
